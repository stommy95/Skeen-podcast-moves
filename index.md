# Detailed podcast review by Tommy Skeen

## **PFW in progress** *A.K.A. patriots football weekly*
### Organization or pattern 
This podcast is one about the New England Patriots football team and its efforts. This podcast is on every Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday from 12:00 pm to 2:00pm except during the offseason where they have their shows only on Tuesdays and Thursdays.
As far as the basic structure of this podcast it is four men discussing the ups and down of the patriots franchise. These personalities include the **BOSS** Fred Kirsch, Andy Hart, Paul Perillo, and Erik Scalavino. With the main people encompassing Fred, Andy, and Paul with Erik as more of a *sideline* reporter where Erik is not always in the show. 
The pattern of the show follows pretty much the same outline every time, eventhough this show is very informal and is pretty much a handful of friends having a conversation about the patriots which branches off most of the time to heated arguments or just crazy tangents about washing machines. This show starts off with an introduction audio clip (see style) then Fred talks for the first couple minutes starting with a "Alllllright" and talks a little bit about what they will be covering in that day's show. Moreover, the rest of the *gang* chimes in and they start having their casual and non-scripted conversation about the topic at hand whether that is Tom Brady's new Superbowl ring or the questionable depth at linebacker you can be sure to be very entertained for two hours. However, the show always has a brake around an hour into it where they stop for around seven minutes to eat some lunch. Then they quickly return to enlighten your day for the remainder of the time they have with you either talking football during the season or some hilarious topic during the offseason.

### Style, sound additions, and effects
The sound additions for this podcast make it in-depth and multi-demensional including:
* Intro audio clip where this is first thing you hear and is usually a quote mash-up from funny movies like office space or any Will Ferrell movies
* Also this show has a producer who doesn't chime in much but plays sound bites a lot of times referring or furthering what they are talking about which I think helps their brand a lot. For example, last week the boys were talking about how Russel Wilson of the Seahawks does not want to be criticised which they thought was ridiculous because everyone should be criticised even the best quarterback ever Tom Brady can be criticsed saying its the only way to learn and develop. Then without hesitiation the producer **Kevin** played a clip taken from a patriots practice where coach Bill Belichick says  "Awww Brady come on! Damnit Brady! run it again, again for god's sake Brady!"
* During their lunch brake they play mostly advertisements.
* At the end of their ads they always have a funny story told on the show from various different episodes with some background music which makes for a very nice transition from content to content.
*Finally they always have this one very calming piano song to close out the show like the oscars where it starts playing so the boys know they have to wrap it up because it its 2:00 pm.

### Narrative types, interviews, and archival material
For starters, this podcast is very informal where nothing is scripted. This show is simply a casual conversation that gets explicit sometimes when heated arugments arise. However, during the season lots of times Erik will call in from patriots practices or one of the other people that work for the patriots will call in and they will have an interview of sorts which pertains to the draft, practice, or just news that needs to be reported.
Furthermore, the podcast is very entertaining because they do not just talk about the patriots, you can call in live to one of their shows and talk about anything from *Game of Thrones* (Fred loves GoT) to your problems with Erik's snobby behavior.

#### Recommendations
I would recomend this podcast to everyone except it is more for patriot nation than anyone else so it is not for most people however, if I find out someone likes the patriots or has not heard of *PFW in progress* I very quickly recomend the show because i think it is an awesome program and is very much a part of my weekly endeavers.
